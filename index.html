    <h1><P>I am a web developer who is in the process of furthering my skills. 
        For the past 12 years I have worked in road contruction, where I learned
        the importance of teamwork and getting the job done right. I loved the
        work but always dreamed of working with computers. I have spent many 
        hours in self-study, as well as taking paid courses to pursue a career
        in web development.</P></h1><hr>
