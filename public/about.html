<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am 31 years old, changing careers after spending 16 years working in road construction.
   A combination of injury and needing more balance between work and home life prompted this decision.
   I prioritize routines that maximize efficiency and accuracy. In my 16 years doing road construction I learned that
  flexibility is a must. Flexibility has given me the ability to keep a good attitude even when things go awry. </p>
